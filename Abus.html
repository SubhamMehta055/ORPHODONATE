     			<h4>Our Mission</h4>   <br>  

     			<p>It is a well-known but somewhat ignored fact that many people die every day of hunger. This is said this because whenever we hear about people dying because of hunger, we are saddened but not many of us are surprised. In fact more people die of hunger than by AIDS or Cancer, etc. out of which India houses 1/3rd. Now, it does mean that we have a lot of ground to cover but it doesn’t mean that it can’t be done. India may be the second most populated country in the world but most of that population consists of people in our generation. So, if we use this infrastructure with a well defined plan, we can tackle this problem eventually.  </p> <br>

     			<p>Our idea is to redistribute the food that gets leftover in parties, functions, marriages, canteen, mess etc  to the nearby orphanages and also to the starving individuals. To start, we are going to target the locality, that in inside Chennai. The individuals can be pinpointed with the help of volunteers, students in colleges who are willing to put in  the work (a lot of colleges have NSS groups that help) and NGOs also have data regarding this as well as the Orphanage sites. </p> <br>

     			<p>Our mission is to start a system that is able to grow up and turn out to be something that takes care of the food necessities of the entire country so that this Hunger-deaths can be eradicated.</p> <br>

     			<h4>Our Vision</h4>   <br>  

     				<p>Our vision is that this system eventually becomes capable to provide all the necessities that a person might need, like clothes, toothpaste, comb, notebooks, and why limit it to just that, if this is able to generate funds, they will go straight to the free education for the same orphanages. We want it such that no person ever blames the situation they are born in and instead are motivated to develop themselves no matter what their initial situation is.</p> <br>
